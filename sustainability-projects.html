Neglecting these dynamics can lead to inaccurate conclusions about carbon neutrality vs. climate neutrality. Dynamic LCA combined with Net Ecosystem Exchange (NEE) provides a new BBM-LCA framework developed at AMIBM.",

The BBM-LCA framework addresses feedstock cultivation phase challenges by incorporating Net Ecosystem Exchange (NEE) and soil carbon models to better describe land-based CO2 emissions.",
