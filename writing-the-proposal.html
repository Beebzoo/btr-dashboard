                    <h3>What is the BTR Proposal?</h3>
                    <p>Proposals should be <strong>informative and persuasive</strong>: they attempt to educate and convince the reader that the research in question is worthwhile (now it is for a high grade, but in the future it may be for funding in the form of grants). Your proposal should not only persuade the reader to consider what is being proposed, but also show the reader that how you will answer your question is practical and appropriate.</p>

                    <div class="info-box">
                        <strong>Purpose:</strong>
                        <p>The proposal should provide the information that the reviewer needs to know in order to understand why and how you are doing this project. This includes clear time planning. The anticipated results should also be discussed.</p>

                        <strong>Strict Word Limit:</strong>
                        <p>The research proposal should be <strong>up to 2000 words</strong>, not including the reference list. There is <strong>no possibility for a word count extension</strong> on the proposal.</p>
                    </div>

                    <p><strong>Why is the word limit strict?</strong></p>
                    <p>Many scientific documents such as papers and (more relevant here) grant proposals have very fixed formatting, including word counts. It is important that you learn to adjust your writing to these requirements, not vice versa. What you leave out is as important as what you put in!</p>

                        <strong>Penalty for Exceeding Word Count:</strong>

                    <p>Appendices are <strong>not contemplated</strong>. If there is a specific case in which you feel like the proposal truly needs an appendix, it should be discussed with the BTR Coordinator.</p>

                            <strong>Critical Rule:</strong>

                        <ul>

                        <strong>Minimum Requirement:</strong>
                        <p>It should contain a <strong>minimum of 15 peer-reviewed scientific journal articles</strong> that you have read and cited within the text (i.e. you should not use references copied from elsewhere that you have not read).</p>
                    </div>

                    <p>Most of these references will be in an extensive literature review.</p>

                    <h3>Citation Style</h3>

                    <div class="warning-box">
                        <strong>Required: Numbered Citations</strong>
                        <p>The BTR proposal <strong>enforces the use of numbered citations</strong>. Please use number citations for in text citations.</p>
                    </div>

                    <p>All proposals should have sequentially numbered references. This is often referred to as <strong>Vancouver style</strong>, in case you want to look at examples of it by yourself.</p>

                    <div class="info-box">
                        <strong>Citation Style Flexibility:</strong>
                        <p>You are under no obligation to follow the APA citation method usually used at MSP. However, ensure your references must be consistent in appearance, format and content for whichever style you choose. The style you use for the references at the end might vary according to the preference of your supervisor.</p>
                    </div>

                    <h4>Typical Reference Format:</h4>
                    <p>References should typically contain:</p>
                    <ul>
                        <li>Author(s)</li>
                        <li>Year of Publication</li>
                        <li>Title of Paper</li>
                        <li>Title of Journal</li>
                        <li>Volume Number (Issue Number)</li>
                        <li>Page numbers</li>
                        <li>DOI (preferably as a hyperlink)</li>
                    </ul>

                    <h3>Reference Management</h3>

                    <div class="success-box">
                        <strong>Best Practice:</strong>
                        <ul>
                            <li>Avoid leaving references until the very last minute</li>
                            <li>Proofread them carefully - many marks are lost through sloppily produced references</li>
                            <li>If you find yourself uncertain about the rules of your chosen citation style, look online for clear explanations and examples</li>
                        </ul>
                    </div>

                    <p>Consider utilising the programme <strong>EndNote</strong>, which can be freely used with our UM campus license. Some may find it more suitable than others.</p>

                    <h3>Word Count Checking</h3>

                    <div class="warning-box">
                        <strong>Your Responsibility:</strong>
                        <p>Make sure you check your word count by using multiple software tools to ensure you meet the word count requirements. It is the Student's responsibility to thoroughly check the wordcount and declare this in the title page.</p>
